<h2>Access to the data</h2>
<p>
Dedicated pages have been provided for the tailspike protein clusters associated with five different pathogen species, facilitating exploration of each individually. To begin, simply select the page corresponding to a specific species by clicking on the tab labeled with the species name. This action will provide you with more detailed information.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Each species-specific section allows data to be easily copied, downloaded, or printed in various formats, enhancing accessibility and use. For in-depth details on tailspike protein clusters and their relationships with bacterial surface polysaccharides, utilize the “Copy”, “CSV”, “Excel”, “PDF”, and “Print” options located at the top of each species page. Additionally, clicking on individual tailspike protein clusters will navigate users to a more comprehensive page, where all sequences within the cluster and the PDB structure of the cluster's representative sequence are available for download.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
For your convenience in downloading data, users will find downloadable links for tailspike protein data specific to each species, as well as databases necessary for the Blast service:
